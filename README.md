# Node load test
Making a simple system to work with load test in specific situations.

<br>

### How is it supposed to work?
<br>
Well... <br>
I'm gonna try to test how Node.js handle with stress tests in different situations, such as doing heavy operations on the database. I'll make a load test having the project configured with different features and see how Node.js reacts.

### Patterns and platforms
- `DDD`: I'll try to write the simple structure based on some DDD principles.
- `SOLID`
- `TDD`: I'll be loyal to this pattern and use the best practices.
- `Knex`: Used to make the database connection easier and as a query builder.
- `Sqlite3`: In memory database (SQL)
- `Typescript`
- `Vitest`: To make unit and functional tests.
- `Autocannon`: Used to make load tests.
